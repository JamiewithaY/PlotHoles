# PlotHoles
Project 1- Austin, Brian and Jayme

Plot holes is a fun movie trivia game made by some fun trive people!

Running is as simple as pulling and installing your packages via npm install. 

We hope to expand functionality at some point but some other projects are getting in the way.
Answers are multiple choice and pretty simple at the moment. the styling alone is worth a clone and checkout!
